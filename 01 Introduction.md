## Large Scale Interactive Simulation Environments for Robot Learning

iGibson 1.0

- iGibson, the Interactive Gibson Environment, is a simulation environment providing __fast visual rendering__ and __physics simulation__ (based on Bullet)
- Packed with a dataset with hundreds of large 3D environments reconstructed from __real homes and offices__, and interactive objects that can be pushed and actuated
- Allows researchers to train and evaluate __robotic agents__ that use RGB images and/or other __visual sensors__ to solve __indoor (interactive) navigation and mobile manipulation tasks__ such as opening doors, picking and placing objects, or searching for objects

iGibson 2.0

- Supports new types of __object state changes__ (cook, soak, slice, freeze, etc), that can enable new types of simulated activities
- Implements all features required to evaluate AI solutions in __the BEHAVIOR benchmark__: sampling logic activity descriptions, checking logic states, connecting to the BEHAVIOR dataset of 3D objects and evaluating BEHAVIOR metrics
