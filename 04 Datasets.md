## Downloading the iGibson Dataset of Scenes and the BEHAVIOR Dataset of Objects

What the dataset contains

- __iGibson 1.0 Dataset of Scenes__: We annotated fifteen 3D reconstructions of real-world scans and converted them into fully interactive scene models. In this process, we respect the original object-instance layout and object-category distribution. The object models are extended from open-source datasets (ShapeNet Dataset, Motion Dataset, SAPIEN Dataset) enriched with annotations of material and dynamic properties.
- __iGibson 2.0 Dataset of Scenes__: New versions of the fifteen fully interactive scenes, more densely populated with objects.
- __BEHAVIOR Dataset of Objects__: Dataset of object models annotated with physical and semantic properties. The 3D models are free to use within iGibson 2.0 for BEHAVIOR (due to artistsâ€™ copyright, models are encrypted and can only to be used within iGibson 2.0).
